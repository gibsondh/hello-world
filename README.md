# hello-world
just another repository
i joined this website because i'm applying for the coolest opportunity i've heard of through my school and i know my gpa is mediocre so i was hoping this could help but i feel like it's going to take way more work than i initially expected. 
it's all chill though, i'm not afraid of hard work.
